========================================
CLASSIFIED: TOP SECRET / SPECIAL ACCESS
OPERATION VALKYRIE - MISSION BRIEF
FIELD DEPLOYMENT SCENARIO: STALAGMITE
========================================

MISSION ID: VLK-7734-G
DATE: 14 APR 1983
AUTHORIZATION: DELTA COMMAND
PRIORITY: ALPHA-ONE

1. MISSION OVERVIEW:
Operation VALKYRIE involves covert infiltration and intelligence gathering at suspected Soviet temporal research facility located at coordinates 61°47'N, 34°22'E (Karelia region). Intelligence suggests the Soviets have achieved limited success replicating aspects of our PEGASUS technology.

2. OBJECTIVES:
   2.1 PRIMARY: Confirm existence of Soviet temporal displacement apparatus
   2.2 PRIMARY: Document all technical specifications and operational parameters
   2.3 SECONDARY: Identify key scientific personnel
   2.4 SECONDARY: Plant passive monitoring devices at facility
   2.5 TERTIARY: Sabotage efforts if practical without detection

3. TEAM COMPOSITION:
   - FIELD COMMANDER: Agent REDWOOD
   - TECHNICAL SPECIALIST: Agent HAWKINS
   - INFILTRATION SPECIALIST: Agent FROST
   - COMBAT SPECIALIST: Agent GRANITE
   - TEMPORAL OBSERVER: Agent MERCURY

4. EQUIPMENT PACKAGE:
   - Standard GHOST infiltration kit
   - YGGDRASIL field terminals (5)
   - Temporal displacement detectors (3)
   - ARGUS surveillance package
   - Winter field gear (Arctic rated)
   - Emergency extraction beacons
   - QKD-encrypted communication devices
   - PHANTOM protocol medical kit

5. MISSION PARAMETERS:
   - Insertion Method: HALO jump from modified SR-71
   - Extraction: Via prearranged coordinates at pickup zone ECHO
   - Timeline: Maximum 72 hours on ground
   - ROE: Non-lethal engagement preferred, defensive measures authorized
   - TEMPORAL DIRECTIVE: Timeline preservation required

6. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   - Soviet presence: HIGH
   - Detection probability: MEDIUM
   - Extraction difficulty: HIGH
   - Temporal anomaly risk: MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Mission success probability: 68%

7. CONTINGENCY PLANS:
   7.1 - STARDUST protocol if temporal anomaly detected
   7.2 - WILDFIRE protocol if facility contains biological agents
   7.3 - NIGHTSHADE protocol if captured
   7.4 - QUICKSILVER emergency evacuation if timeline disturbance detected

8. COMMUNICATION SCHEDULE:
   - Check-in required every 6 hours via YGGDRASIL
   - Missed check-in triggers WATCHMAN alert protocol
   - Emergency channel: QKD frequency 373.82 MHz

9. INTELLIGENCE NOTES:
Lead scientist believed to be Dr. Mikhail Sokolov, former protégé of Andrei Sakharov. Known to have extensive theoretical knowledge of Einstein-Rosen bridges. Facility is disguised as weather research station with approximately 30-40 personnel. Suspected to have achieved at least one successful temporal displacement event in February 1983.

Remember: Timeline integrity is paramount. No future knowledge to be revealed under any circumstances. Temporal Displacement Detectors must remain active at all times.
