WARNING: THIS DOCUMENT CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING NATIONAL SECURITY.
UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PENALTIES.

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
   The Montauk Psychotronic Chair (MPC) functions as a non-linear temporal interface
   designed to amplify and direct psychic energy via Tesla coil harmonics to generate
   controlled spacetime distortions.

2. OPERATIONAL COMPONENTS:
   2.1 Primary Chair Assembly - Neodymium-tungsten alloy frame, orgone accumulator cushions
   2.2 Tesla Array - 3 primary coils (20ft), 12 secondary resonance coils
   2.3 Temporal Reference Calibration Unit (DELTA-7)
   2.4 Cray XMP/IBM 360 Hybrid Interface System
   2.5 EMF Dampening Field Generators (6)
   2.6 Subject Monitoring Systems
       - EEG (24-channel modified)
       - Heart rate/Respiration
       - Skin conductance
       - Pupillary response
       - Pineal gland activity monitor

3. PREPARATION PROTOCOLS:
   3.1 System Initialization (Min. 3 hrs before operation)
       - Power-up sequence must follow Appendix A precisely
       - Delta wave calibration requires 45 min stabilization
       - Coil temperature must not exceed 47Â°C

   3.2 Subject Preparation
       - No metallic objects on person
       - Administer Compound Y-4 (see dosage chart, pg. 43)
       - Initial isolation period: 4 hours minimum
       - Psychic baseline measurement required

4. OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS:
   4.1 Maximum continuous operation: 22 minutes
   4.2 Cooldown period between sessions: 4 hours minimum
   4.3 No more than 3 operators within 20ft radius during active phase
   4.4 Emergency shutdown procedures - See Appendix C

5. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
   5.1 Temporal Convergence Events (TCE)
       - If Delta reading exceeds 9.7, initiate RAPID SHUTDOWN
       - Document all visions/phenomena reported by operator
       - Temporal echo phenomena may persist up to 72 hours

   5.2 Subject Selection
       - Psychic sensitivity rating must exceed 7.4 on Brandenburg scale
       - Previous timeline divergence experience preferred
       - Dexterous chronoception ability required

6. MAINTENANCE:
   6.1 Coil retuning required after every 3 operational cycles
   6.2 Orgone accumulators must be purged bi-weekly
   6.3 Crystal array replacement schedule - See Appendix F

7. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES:
   7.1 Timeline Divergence Event (ALABASTER Protocol)
   7.2 Operator Synaptic Overload (CRIMSON Protocol)
   7.3 Temporal Bleedthrough (INDIGO Protocol)
   7.4 Reality Anchor Failure (OBSIDIAN Protocol)

8. RESULTS CLASSIFICATION:
   ALL observations, recordings, and temporal artifacts are classified COSMIC TOP SECRET.
   Debriefing protocols MUST follow Section 12 guidelines.
