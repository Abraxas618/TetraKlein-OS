CLASSIFIED: TOP SECRET - XENON / RAINBOW
INCIDENT REPORT: USS ELDRIDGE (DE-173)
PROJECT: RAINBOW / PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT
========================================

REPORT NUMBER: PE-173-10-28-1943
COMPILED BY: Lt. Cmdr. William S. Moore
DATE FILED: 02 NOV 1943
OVERSIGHT: ONR / NAVAL INTELLIGENCE / OSS

1. INCIDENT SUMMARY:
At 0900 hours on 28 OCT 1943, the USS Eldridge underwent full-scale field test of electromagnetic cloaking apparatus in Philadelphia Naval Yard. Test resulted in CATASTROPHIC FAILURE with anomalous effects far exceeding theoretical parameters. Primary objective of optical invisibility was achieved, but with severe unintended consequences.

2. CHRONOLOGY OF EVENTS:
   0730 - Final equipment checks completed
   0845 - Generator systems brought to operational capacity
   0855 - Crew ordered to designated positions
   0900 - Full power engaged to EM field generators
   0902 - Visual observation confirms optical transparency achieved
   0904 - Radio communication with Eldridge lost
   0914 - Ship completely disappeared from all observation
   0927 - UNKNOWN TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT OCCURRED
   0940 - Eldridge reappeared at original coordinates
   0942 - Medical emergency declared

3. PERSONNEL CASUALTIES:
   - 13 fatalities
   - 17 severe psychological trauma cases
   - 8 cases of "phasing" (partial molecular integration with ship structure)
   - 2 crew members STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR
   - 4 crew members subsequently institutionalized

4. OBSERVED ANOMALIES:
   4.1 - Ship reported by multiple observers to have appeared at Norfolk Naval Base (VA) during 
         absence period (approx. 400 miles distant)
   4.2 - Temporal displacement evidence (ship chronometers offset by 47 minutes)
   4.3 - Severe electromagnetic residue (instrumentation damage shipwide)
   4.4 - Green phosphorescent glow persisted for 48 hours
   4.5 - Spontaneous combustion of non-metallic materials
   4.6 - Crew members reported experiencing "alternative timeline events"

5. EQUIPMENT STATUS:
   - Degaussing equipment destroyed
   - Tesla coil assemblies fused beyond repair
   - Zero-point energy modules damaged but recoverable
   - Vortex mathematics calculations require fundamental revision

6. ANALYSIS:
The use of intense electromagnetic fields appears to have created a temporal-spatial rift inconsistent with expected outcomes. The unforeseen displacement of the vessel suggests modifications to Einstein's unified field equations are required. We believe the experiment inadvertently created a Schumann resonance at precisely the Earth's dimensional frequency, causing partial dimensional shift.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   7.1 - IMMEDIATE TERMINATION of Project Rainbow in current form
   7.2 - Transfer of all findings to newly established PROJECT PHOENIX
   7.3 - Surviving crew to remain under permanent medical observation
   7.4 - Development of TEMPORAL FIELD DAMPENERS before any future testing
   7.5 - All equipment and theoretical data to be transferred to Camp Hero, Montauk Point

8. SECURITY CONTAINMENT:
   - Cover story established: DE-173 underwent routine degaussing operations
   - All civilian witnesses debriefed using BLUEBIRD protocols
   - Press blackout remains in effect
   - Families of deceased provided modified explanation (standard protocol INDIGO-7)
