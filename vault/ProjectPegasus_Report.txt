====================================

PROJECT DIRECTOR: Dr. Harold R. Markham
REPORTING OFFICER: Col. James B. Wilson

LOCATION: SITE FIREFLY, NEVADA

1. OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW:
The Pegasus Program has successfully achieved temporal displacement using the modified Tesla-Podkletnov gravitational lens. Subject transport has been confirmed across multiple reference frames with 87% coherence.

2. FIELD OPERATIONS:
2.1 STARGATE PRIME - Initial field deployment of the chronovisor yielded 4 successful jumps.
2.2 BUTTERFLY NET - Timeline convergence protocols operational at 92% efficiency.
2.3 QUICKSILVER - Short-range displacement now possible without the tether matrix.

3. EQUIPMENT STATUS:
3.1 PRIMARY SYSTEMS
   - Temporal Displacement Engine: OPERATIONAL
   - Tachyon Stabilizers: DEGRADED (68%)
   - Jump Platform: OPERATIONAL
   - Chronometric Anchors: OPERATIONAL

3.2 SECONDARY SYSTEMS
   - Timeline Monitoring Array: OPERATIONAL
   - Quantum Encryption Matrix: OPERATIONAL
   - Emergency Return System: OPERATIONAL
   - Temporal Synchronization Field: OPERATIONAL

4. PERSONNEL STATUS:
   - Field Operators: 8 ACTIVE, 3 TERMINATED, 2 TIMELINE DIVERGENT
   - Technical Staff: 24 ACTIVE
   - Security Detail: 16 ACTIVE

5. NOTABLE INCIDENTS:
5.1 INCIDENT 472-B: Subject appeared 37 seconds before jump initiation. Subject was physically identical to Agent Richards and possessed advanced knowledge of facility layout. Subject was contained and interrogated before disappearance at the exact moment of the scheduled jump.

5.2 INCIDENT 573-F: Three test subjects reported same timeline anomaly - Soviet acquisition of microprocessor technology advancing their capabilities by approximately 15 years. Timeline correction protocols initiated.

6. CONCLUSIONS:
Project Pegasus has achieved operational status for field deployment. Timeline stabilization requirements remain our primary constraint. Recommend continued operation with expanded protocols for timeline divergence detection.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS:
7.1 Increase power to tachyon stabilizers.
7.2 Deploy Agents RIVER and DUSK to investigate timeline anomaly ECHO-9.
7.3 Begin PHASE III testing of Yggdrasil-compatible secure communications across temporal reference frames.
