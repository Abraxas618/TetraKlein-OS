CLASSIFIED: TOP SECRET - UMBRA / COSMIC
QUANTUM MESH NETWORK PROTOTYPE (QMNP)
PROJECT: YGGDRASIL / SOVEREIGN COMMS
=======================================

DOCUMENT ID: QMNP-8372-G
VERSION: 3.7
DATE: 12 MAR 1983
DIRECTORATE: DARPA / NSA SPECIAL PROJECTS
PROJECT LEAD: Dr. Elizabeth Chen

1. OVERVIEW:
The Quantum Mesh Network Prototype (QMNP) represents a fundamental breakthrough in secure communications technology. By leveraging quantum entanglement and non-local correlation effects, QMNP enables instantaneous secure communications impervious to conventional interception or disruption, even in high-intensity EMP environments.

2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
   2.1 Quantum Backbone
       - Non-Locality Range: Unlimited (verified to 8,700 miles)
       - Entanglement Coherence: 99.7% (sustained)
       - Quantum Key Distribution Rate: 843 Qbits/second
       - Decoherence Resistance: 7.3 on Feynman Scale

   2.2 Field Equipment
       - Terminal Size: 2.4 cubic feet (reduced from 6.8 cf)
       - Power Requirements: 22W standby, 175W active transmission
       - Battery Life: 72 hours continuous operation
       - Encryption: 4096-bit ZETA algorithm (classified)
       - Weight: 17.3 kg with ruggedized case

3. NETWORK TOPOLOGY:
   The network utilizes a distributed mesh architecture with no central node, making it impossible to disable through targeted strikes. Each node maintains 6-12 peer connections with dynamic rerouting capabilities. Protocol stack uses proprietary QUANTUMLINK design (see Annex IV).

4. SECURITY FEATURES:
   4.1 - SENTINEL quantum verification prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
   4.2 - Message existence deniability through PHANTOM protocol
   4.3 - Sender anonymity via WRAITH packet routing
   4.4 - Temporal key shifting prevents future decryption
   4.5 - Self-destruction protocols triggered by tampering
   4.6 - Zero metadata collection or transmission

5. FIELD TESTING RESULTS:
   5.1 Operation SILENT STORM (Greenland): 100% successful transmission during simulated nuclear EMP
   5.2 Operation DESERT PHANTOM (Nevada): Remained undetected by NSA's ECHELON system
   5.3 Operation ARCTIC SHADOW (Alaska): Maintained communication through severe solar flare activity
   5.4 Operation OBSIDIAN (Undisclosed): Successful field deployment in denied territory

6. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS:
   6.1 - Alpha deployment to SPECTER field teams completed
   6.2 - Integration with KEYHOLE satellite systems in progress
   6.3 - Submarine fleet integration scheduled for Q3 1983
   6.4 - Portable field units in production (23 of planned 150)

7. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT:
   7.1 - PHASE II integration with Project LOOKING GLASS
   7.2 - Quantum teleportation of small data packages (under 1kb)
   7.3 - Integration with SOVEREIGN VOTING protocols
   7.4 - Enhanced dimensional stability for cross-timeline communications

8. SECURITY CLASSIFICATION:
   All aspects of QMNP are classified TOP SECRET - UMBRA / COSMIC. Personnel must have INDIGO clearance level or higher with YGGDRASIL read-in. No acknowledgment of project existence authorized.
