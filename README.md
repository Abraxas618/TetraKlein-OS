## Requirements

- Podman or Docker installed
- 64MB RAM minimum
- Secure environment

## Quick Deployment

### Linux/macOS
Run the deployment script to build and launch the TetraKlein-OS Field Terminal:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

### Windows
Run the PowerShell deployment script:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File deploy.ps1
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Check if port 8080 is already in use (the system will try port 3000 as fallback)
2. Verify that Podman/Docker is running
3. Check container logs:
   ```
   podman logs tetraklein-os
   ```
4. Try running in foreground mode for debugging:
   ```
   podman run --rm -it -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -v "$(pwd)/vault:/app/vault:Z" tetraklein-os
   ```

## Access Points

- Terminal Interface: http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Security Features

- RAM-only operation â€” container destroys itself after stop
- Public-facing services bound to localhost only
- Hardened Node.js server with security headers
- No directory listing

## Architecture

- Alpine Linux base (minimal footprint)
- Node.js + Express
- No external frameworks (no React, Vite, or Webpack)

## Important Notes

1. The container is configured to self-destruct when stopped
2. All data stored in the vault folder is mounted from the host
3. No data is persisted within the container after shutdown
4. Yggdrasil daemon runs as a background service
