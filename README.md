# TetraKlein OS – Field Tactical Deployment v1.0
## README / Operations Manual

# 🛡️ Introduction
TetraKlein OS is a fully sovereign, RAM-only, quantum-resilient tactical operating system engineered for sensitive field operations in high-threat environments.

Built for zero-trust, zero-disk, and post-quantum cryptographic resilience, TetraKlein ensures that no forensic trace remains after shutdown or extraction.

# 📦 What Makes TetraKlein OS Different?
- RAM-Only Operation
- Self-Contained Internal HTTPS Services
- Post-Quantum Cryptographic Resilience
- Dynamic Sovereign Certificate Authority
- Yggdrasil Mesh Capability (Optional)
- Emergency Memory Purge

# 🌐 Internal Networking Model
- Localhost Services (127.0.0.1) active
- No outbound connections unless permitted
- Mesh Networking (Yggdrasil) optional

# 🛰️ How Yggdrasil Works
Yggdrasil is a self-organizing, fully encrypted IPv6 mesh network allowing multiple TetraKlein nodes to:
- Discover each other
- Form private, sovereign mesh communications
- Route internal HTTPS traffic without exposing public IPs

# 🛠️ Installation Instructions
## Install Podman

Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman
```

Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y podman
```

Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S podman
```

## Prepare TetraKlein
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xvzf tetraklein_os_v1.0.tar.gz
cd tetraklein_os_build
podman build -t tetraklein-os .
```

# 🚀 Deployment
## Launch
```bash
./deploy_tetraklein.sh
```

Access:
```
https://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Accept self-signed cert.

## Emergency RAM Purge
```bash
./purge_tetraklein.sh
```

# 🔐 Security Model
- Disk Writes: Forbidden
- RAM Operations: Ephemeral only
- No static key storage
- No network exposure by default

# 🧬 Cryptographic Architecture
- TLS Certificates: RSA-4096
- Entropy Source: GREG Daemon
- Optional Yggdrasil Mesh: Curve25519 encryption

# 📋 Commands Cheat Sheet
| Purpose | Command |
|:---|:---|
| Build Container | podman build -t tetraklein-os . |
| Launch OS | ./deploy_tetraklein.sh |
| Access Dashboard | https://127.0.0.1:8080 |
| Purge RAM | ./purge_tetraklein.sh |
| Rotate Certificates | ./tls_gen.sh |

# 📚 Operational Doctrine
- Boot securely
- Trust no external network
- Purge after mission
- Mesh only with trusted nodes
