TOP SECRET - EYES ONLY
PROJECT RAINBOW - PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT
CLASSIFIED REPORT #1943-08-13

OPERATION OVERVIEW:
- Project Rainbow initiated under direct order of President Roosevelt
- Primary objective: Develop naval vessel invisibility technology
- Secondary objective: Test Einstein's Unified Field Theory
- Location: Philadelphia Naval Shipyard
- Test vessel: USS Eldridge (DE-173)

KEY PERSONNEL:
- Dr. John Von Neumann (Project Lead)
- Dr. Albert Einstein (Theoretical Physics)
- Nikola Tesla (Technical Advisor)
- Lt. Edward Cameron (Navy Liaison)
- Lt. Duncan Cameron (Technical Officer)

EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT:
1. Two large Tesla coils (75-foot radius)
2. Four RF transmitters (2 megawatts each)
3. Three thousand 6L6 power amplifier tubes
4. Special synchronizing and modulation circuits
5. Magnetic field generators

TEST SEQUENCE:
1. Initial power-up: 08:00 EST
2. Field generation: 08:15 EST
3. Full invisibility achieved: 08:17 EST
4. Temporal displacement detected: 08:18 EST
5. Emergency shutdown: 08:19 EST

RESULTS:
- Primary objective achieved: Complete optical invisibility
- Secondary objective achieved: Temporal displacement confirmed
- Unintended effects: Crew members fused with bulkheads
- Temporal anomalies: Multiple crew members reported time jumps
- Radiation exposure: Severe burns on 40% of crew

CRITICAL INCIDENTS:
1. Temporal displacement of Cameron brothers
2. Partial crew materialization in Norfolk
3. Severe psychological trauma in survivors
4. Multiple cases of spontaneous combustion

CLASSIFIED OBSERVATIONS:
- Time travel confirmed possible
- Human consciousness can survive temporal displacement
- Matter can exist in multiple time periods simultaneously
- Temporal field manipulation affects biological aging

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Immediate project termination
2. Classify all findings as TOP SECRET
3. Implement memory suppression protocols
4. Relocate surviving crew members
5. Destroy all experimental equipment

FINAL ASSESSMENT:
Project Rainbow successfully demonstrated both invisibility and time travel capabilities. However, the human cost and unpredictable nature of temporal effects make this technology too dangerous for current deployment. Recommend immediate cessation of all related research.
