   - Maintain consciousness

3. Safety Measures:
   - Check temporal lock
   - Verify quantum stability
   - Monitor field strength
   - Prepare emergency shutdown

WARNING: Improper use may result in:
- Temporal dislocation
- Consciousness fragmentation
- Reality perception distortion
- Accelerated aging
- Spontaneous materialization

MAINTENANCE:
1. Daily temporal lock check
2. Weekly quantum circuit calibration
3. Monthly caduceus coil inspection
4. Quarterly complete system test
5. Annual component replacement

CLASSIFIED NOTES:
- Maximum safe temporal displacement: 30 years
- Requires psychic operator for best results
- Can be used for both forward and backward travel
- Works best near natural vortex points
- Effectiveness increases during full moon
